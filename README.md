# 👤 Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This is a simple real-time face detection project using Python and OpenCV. It utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces from a webcam feed and draws green rectangles around any detected faces.




## 🔬 What Are Haar Cascades?

**Haar cascades** are machine learning-based classifiers used to detect objects.  
They work by training a cascade function from many positive and negative images and then scanning input images to detect features like eyes, faces, etc.




## 🧠 How It Works

Here’s how it works step-by-step:

1. 🖼️ Captures real-time video from your webcam.
2. 🎛️ Converts each frame to grayscale.
3. 🤖 Applies the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces.
4. ✅ Draws a **green rectangle** around each detected face.
5. 🔁 Repeats this process in real-time for every frame.
